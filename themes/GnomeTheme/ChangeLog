	* NSTabView+Gnome.m: Use new theme methods.

	* Initial import; thus dicontinuing my git repository on
	http://github.com/hansfbaier/gnustep-gnome
	note that as of now the theme crashes when activated with
	SystemPreferences.app, but it works when activated with defaults
	Note also, this isn't perfect yet and still has a lot of rough
	edges (eg. the Makefile), contributions welcome ;)
