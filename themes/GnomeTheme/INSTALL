Installation
------------

Just compile the Gnome bundle : 

	make

and as superuser:

        make install

Now, just try to activate the theme (for example with SystemPrefrences.app)
and run a GNUstep program ... :-)

NOTE: As of now, SystemPreferences crashes on GnomeTheme, but setting the theme like this works:

defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSTheme GnomeTheme
