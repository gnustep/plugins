Gnome Theme
========

Gnome is a theme engine for GNUstep which 
uses the current Gtk+-Theme selected in Gnome
for drawing its widgets.

Note, that this currently crashes when used 
with SystemPreferences.app,
but it works when activated like this:

defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSTheme GnomeTheme

Installation
------------

as usual, but if you like, then
see the INSTALL file.
